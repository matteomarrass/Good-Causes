Hello, welcome another time in my GitHub, I'm proud to introduce you to my new project!

* Overview

This is my new project, it's about a charity, and its name (fantasy name) is Good Causes!
It has numerous active projects in all over the world, from Asia to Africa to South America, and gives various services to people, starting from free food to even psychologists!

* Palette colours

I decided to use warm color, to indicate our warmness and hospitality that we deserve for the people.
In this case, I choosed this palette (in order from darkest to lightest) :

* B1B2FF
* AAC4FF
* D2DAFF
* EEF1FF

* Folder Subdivision
